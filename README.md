# Password_Strength_Checker

A lightweight, Python-based utility designed to evaluate the strength of passwords based on industry-standard security metrics. This tool provides real-time feedback on password complexity and suggests improvements to mitigate common vulnerabilities like brute-force or dictionary attacks.
## Key Features
Length Validation: Ensures passwords meet the minimum recommended length (8+ characters).

Character Diversity Check: Verifies the presence of:
Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Numerical digits (0-9)
Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, %)
Strength Scoring: Categorizes passwords into Weak, Medium, or Strong based on a weighted scoring system.
Actionable Feedback: Provides specific suggestions if a password fails a criteria (e.g., "Add a special character").

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python 3.x

No external libraries required (uses the built-in re and string modules).
